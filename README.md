# not a crumb.

This repo is for a fictional baking business that I own in an alternate universe.

## Why a baking business?

I love to bake and have often daydreamed about opening a baking buisness or cafe. However, I know how much hardwork and how many lost weekends that would involve, so rather than attempt to be a buisness owner I've decided to create this fictional website.
Plus, _*who doesn't love looking at pictures of cake!*_

### What I'm hoping to show in this repo

It will be a great way for me to implement all the HTML, CSS and javascript skills I've been learning.
I intend to:

- [ ] Set up a photo carousel which shows examples of my previous bakes
- [ ] Make a form for people to 'submit' orders
- [ ] Have a blog with my favourite recipes
- [ ] Make a calculator function to price orders
