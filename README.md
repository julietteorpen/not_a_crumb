# not a crumb.

This repo is for a fictional baking business that I own in an alternate universe.

## Why a baking business?

I love to bake and have often daydreamed about opening a baking buisness or cafe. However, I know how much hardwork and how many lost weekends that would involve, so rather than attempt to be a buisness owner I've decided to create this fictional website.
Plus, _*who doesn't love looking at pictures of cake!*_

### What I'm hoping to show in this repo

It will be a great way for me to implement all the HTML, CSS and javascript skills I've been learning.
I intend to:

- [x] Set up a grid of photos and tiles which shows photos of cakes and link to elements on the page
- [ ] Set up a photo carousel or interactive photo element to display images
- [x] Make a form for people to design their cake orders
- [ ] Make a functioning 'visualiser' so that a SVG version of the cake appears when order is submitted
- [ ] Have a blog with my favourite recipes
- [x] Make a calculator function to price orders

#### Notes on where I'm at and issues I'm working on:
CAKE VISUALISER:
- The visualiser is not currently working as I am going to remove the images from the HTML - I am going to adjust the function so that rather than hiding/ displaying all the images in the HTML - instead the correct image will be selected and added to the DOM.
- At the moment the form when 1 - 4 tiers are selected in the form, an image of the cake with the appropriate number of tiers will appear once submit is clicked. 
- I'm working on the JS and graphics so that the exact cake entered will appear  (e.g. chocolate cake with candles vs vanilla cake with sprinkles)
- The visualiser will also calculate a price which currently appears in the console log. I plan to make this appear alongside the cake and want to make the pricing structure less basic. 

GENERAL UX and UI
- More needs to be done to the layout and improving the photo grid when not on a mobile device.
